SeerIntelligence is a private security company with a simple goal, making security cheap, and privacy free.


### Business model

SeerIntelligence is a two-person project. We aim to offer security as a service, which consumers can acquire at an incredibly low cost, and sometimes for free. Our goal is to create a self-hosted ecosystem so companies and small businesses can keep their data in-house, as opposed to relying on third-party services for the integrity of their defenses.

### Ideology

We find the current security meta to be an invasive model. We believe that privacy is a human right, and the first step to preserving it is reliability from service providers. One cannot expect privacy for individuals when the companies they trust are insecure. The current meta for security services is invasive because it creates a chain of trust between security companies and their service providers. When a link in this chain is inevitably broken, the flaw in this model becomes very clear.

We aim to provide services without complicating the chain of trust between the company and its users, thereby reducing the number of parties the end user has to trust with their data.

### Methodology

We provide a range of security tools that can be tailored to fit your company's architecture. These tools include CI/CD code scanners, automatic security scanners, OSINT tools, and leak alerts. Currently, we exclusively support Linux-based infrastructure. We do not foresee supporting Windows in the future, as we believe it is not suitable for servers and distributed systems.

### SOSCS

The "Seer Open Standard of Cyber-Security" (SOSCS) is our open letter to organizations. We have curated a checklist and algorithm to quantitatively measure the security of organizations or infrastructure in general. Our goal is to establish SOSCS as a definitive standard for security, much like a bible in the field.

### Privacy

Similar to our open standard of security, we are also proposing an open standard of privacy. We will curate a list of common everyday tools and software, assess their level of privacy-friendliness, and recommend alternatives where applicable.

### Where to go from here?

The project is still incomplete, so stay tuned.
